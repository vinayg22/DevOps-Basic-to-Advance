## 1: Linux File System
Here's a brief overview of the Linux file system, some useful commands, and examples:

The Linux file system is hierarchical, starting from the root directory (`/`). Here are some key directories:

- **`/`**: Root directory, the top-level directory.
- **`/bin`**: Contains essential binary executables.
- **`/etc`**: Configuration files for the system.
- **`/home`**: User home directories.
- **`/var`**: Variable files, such as logs.
- **`/usr`**: User programs and utilities.
- **`/tmp`**: Temporary files.

### Useful Commands
Sure! Here are some examples of the Linux file system structure and its directories:

### Examples of Linux File System Directories

4. **Check the usage of Disk Space and the individual directories under root(/).**


## 3. Permissions and Ownership :

### Linux Filesystem Permissions and Ownership

In Linux, each file and directory has associated permissions and ownership that determine who can read, write, or execute the file. Understanding these concepts is crucial for managing system security and user access.

#### Ownership
Each file and directory has three types of ownership:
1. **User (Owner)**: The user who owns the file.
2. **Group**: A group of users who share access permissions.
3. **Others**: All other users.

#### Permissions
Permissions are divided into three categories:
1. **Read (r)**: Permission to read the contents of the file or directory.
2. **Write (w)**: Permission to modify the file or directory.
3. **Execute (x)**: Permission to execute the file or traverse the directory.

Permissions are represented in a string of 10 characters, such as `-rwxr-xr--`. The first character indicates the file type (`-` for a regular file, `d` for a directory), and the remaining nine characters represent the permissions for the user, group, and others.

#### Example
Consider the following example:
```bash
-rwxr-xr--
```
- `-`: Regular file.
- `rwx`: User (owner) has read, write, and execute permissions.
- `r-x`: Group has read and execute permissions.
- `r--`: Others have read-only permissions.

#### Changing Permissions
You can change permissions using the `chmod` command. For example:
```bash
chmod 755 file.txt
```
This sets the permissions to `rwxr-xr-x`, meaning the owner can read, write, and execute, while the group and others can only read and execute.

#### Changing Ownership
You can change ownership using the `chown` command. For example:
```bash
chown user:group file.txt
```
This changes the owner to `user` and the group to `group`.

### Examples

1. **Viewing Permissions**
   ```bash
   ls -l file.txt
   ```
   *Output*:
   ```bash
   -rw-r--r-- 1 user group 1234 Mar 18 12:34 file.txt
   ```

2. **Changing Permissions**
   ```bash
   chmod 644 file.txt
   ```
   *Explanation*: Sets permissions to `rw-r--r--`, meaning the owner can read and write, while the group and others can only read.

3. **Changing Ownership**
   ```bash
   chown newuser:newgroup file.txt
   ```
   *Explanation*: Changes the owner to `newuser` and the group to `newgroup`.

Understanding and managing permissions and ownership is essential for maintaining a secure and well-organized Linux system. 

Great! Let's dive into some more advanced examples of Linux filesystem permissions and ownership.

### Advanced Examples

#### 1. **Setting Special Permissions**
Special permissions include the setuid, setgid, and sticky bit. These permissions provide additional security and functionality.

- **setuid (Set User ID)**: When set on an executable file, the file runs with the permissions of the file owner, not the user running the file.
  ```bash
  chmod u+s /path/to/executable
  ```
  *Example*: Sets the setuid bit on an executable file.
  ```bash
  -rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 12345 Mar 18 12:34 /path/to/executable
  ```

- **setgid (Set Group ID)**: When set on a directory, new files created within the directory inherit the group of the directory.
  ```bash
  chmod g+s /path/to/directory
  ```
  *Example*: Sets the setgid bit on a directory.
  ```bash
  drwxrwsr-x 2 user group 4096 Mar 18 12:34 /path/to/directory
  ```

- **Sticky Bit**: When set on a directory, only the file owner can delete or rename files within the directory.
  ```bash
  chmod +t /path/to/directory
  ```
  *Example*: Sets the sticky bit on a directory.
  ```bash
  drwxrwxrwt 2 user group 4096 Mar 18 12:34 /path/to/directory
  ```

#### 2. **Recursive Permission Changes**
Changing permissions recursively affects all files and directories within a specified directory.

- **Recursive Change of Permissions**
  ```bash
  chmod -R 755 /path/to/directory
  ```
  *Example*: Sets permissions to `rwxr-xr-x` for all files and directories within the specified directory.

- **Recursive Change of Ownership**
  ```bash
  chown -R user:group /path/to/directory
  ```
  *Example*: Changes the owner to `user` and the group to `group` for all files and directories within the specified directory.

#### 3. **Using `find` with Permissions**
The `find` command can be used to locate files with specific permissions and perform actions on them.

- **Finding Files with Specific Permissions**
  ```bash
  find /path/to/search -type f -perm 644
  ```
  *Example*: Finds all files with permissions `644` in the specified path.

- **Changing Permissions of Found Files**
  ```bash
  find /path/to/search -type f -perm 644 -exec chmod 600 {} \;
  ```
  *Example*: Finds all files with permissions `644` and changes them to `600`.

#### 4. **Access Control Lists (ACLs)**
ACLs provide a more flexible permission mechanism for file systems.

- **Setting an ACL**
  ```bash
  setfacl -m u:username:rwx /path/to/file
  ```
  *Example*: Grants `username` read, write, and execute permissions on the specified file.

- **Viewing ACLs**
  ```bash
  getfacl /path/to/file
  ```
  *Example*: Displays the ACLs of the specified file.

- **Removing an ACL**
  ```bash
  setfacl -x u:username /path/to/file
  ```
  *Example*: Removes the ACL entry for `username` on the specified file.

These advanced examples provide greater control and flexibility in managing permissions and ownership in Linux.
### Best Practices for Managing Permissions in Linux

1. **Implement Least Privilege**: Grant users the minimum permissions necessary to perform their tasks. This reduces the risk of accidental or malicious changes.

2. **Regular Audits**: Periodically review permissions to ensure they are still appropriate. Remove unnecessary permissions and accounts.

3. **Use Groups**: Assign permissions to groups rather than individual users. This simplifies management and ensures consistency.

4. **Avoid Shared Accounts**: Each user should have a unique account to ensure accountability and traceability.

5. **Log and Monitor**: Keep logs of permission changes and monitor for suspicious activity. This helps in identifying and responding to security incidents.

6. **Document Changes**: Maintain documentation of permission setups and changes. This is vital for troubleshooting and reviewing access controls.

### Using ACLs Effectively in Linux

Access Control Lists (ACLs) provide more granular control over file permissions than the standard user/group/other model. Here are some best practices for using ACLs effectively:

1. **Understand Basic ACL Commands**:
   - **View ACLs**: Use `getfacl` to view ACL entries.
     ```bash
     getfacl filename
     ```
   - **Set ACLs**: Use `setfacl` to set new ACL entries.
     ```bash
     setfacl -m u:username:rwx filename
     ```
   - **Default ACLs**: Use `setfacl -d` to set default ACLs on directories.
     ```bash
     setfacl -d -m u:username:rwx dirname
     ```

2. **Regular Audits**: Regularly review ACL settings to ensure they meet access needs and security requirements.

3. **Document ACL Changes**: Record every ACL change. Documentation is crucial for troubleshooting and reviewing permission setups.

4. **Use Default ACLs for Directories**: Set default ACLs on directories to ensure new files inherit the correct permissions automatically.

5. **Avoid Overuse**: While ACLs offer detailed control, overuse can complicate management. Use them judiciously.

6. **Combine with Standard Permissions**: Use ACLs in conjunction with standard permissions to maintain a balance between simplicity and control.

### Example Commands

- **Viewing ACLs**:
  ```bash
  getfacl /home/user/file.txt
  ```

- **Setting ACLs**:
  ```bash
  setfacl -m u:john:rwx /home/user/file.txt
  ```

- **Setting Default ACLs**:
  ```bash
  setfacl -d -m u:john:rwx /home/user/directory
  ```

These practices and commands help ensure secure and efficient management of permissions and ACLs in Linux.

To create a new group, use the `groupadd` command:
```bash
sudo groupadd groupname
```
*Example*:
```bash
sudo groupadd developers
```
This command creates a new group named `developers`.

#### 6. **Adding a User to a Group**
To add a user to a group, use the `usermod` command:
```bash
sudo usermod -aG groupname username
```
*Example*:
```bash
sudo usermod -aG developers john
```
This command adds the user `john` to the `developers` group.

   ```bash
   setfacl -m u:alice:rw /home/shared/resource.txt
   ```

5. **Delete a User and Their Home Directory**:
   ```bash
   sudo userdel -r alice
   ```

These commands and examples cover the basics of creating, deleting, and managing users and groups, as well as setting permissions and enhancing security in Linux. 

### User and Group Roles in Linux

#### User Roles
1. **Root User**: The superuser with unrestricted access to the entire system. Can perform any operation, including system-level changes.
   - **Command**: `sudo su` or `sudo -i`
   - Example: `sudo su` switches to the root user.

2. **Regular Users**: Standard users with limited permissions. They can access their own files and directories but need elevated permissions to access system files.
   - Example: `john`, `alice`

3. **System Users**: Users created for running specific system services and applications. They typically do not have login access.
   - Example: `www-data` (used by web servers like Apache)

#### Group Roles
1. **Primary Group**: Each user is assigned a primary group, usually with the same name as the username. This group is used for default file permissions.
   - Example: User `john` has a primary group `john`.

2. **Secondary Groups**: Users can be members of additional groups, which grant them access to shared resources.
   - Example: User `john` can be added to the `developers` group.

### Best Practices for Managing Users, Groups, and Security

#### 1. **Implement Least Privilege**
Grant users the minimum permissions necessary to perform their tasks. This reduces the risk of accidental or malicious changes.

#### 2. **Regular Audits**
Periodically review user accounts and group memberships to ensure they are still appropriate. Remove unnecessary accounts and permissions.

#### 3. **Use Groups for Permissions**
Assign permissions to groups rather than individual users. This simplifies management and ensures consistency.

#### 4. **Avoid Shared Accounts**
Each user should have a unique account to ensure accountability and traceability.

#### 5. **Strong Password Policies**
Enforce strong password policies, including complexity requirements and regular password changes.

#### 6. **Log and Monitor**
Keep logs of user activities and monitor for suspicious behavior. This helps in identifying and responding to security incidents.

#### 7. **Document Changes**
Maintain documentation of user and group setups and changes. This is vital for troubleshooting and reviewing access controls.

#### 8. **Use Access Control Lists (ACLs)**
For more granular permissions, use ACLs to grant specific access rights to users and groups.

### Examples

1. **Creating a User and Setting Password**:
   ```bash
   sudo useradd alice
   sudo passwd alice
   ```

2. **Creating a Group and Adding User to Group**:
   ```bash
   sudo groupadd admins
   sudo usermod -aG admins alice
   ```

3. **Setting File Permissions and Ownership**:
   ```bash
   chmod 644 /home/alice/document.txt
   sudo chown alice:admins /home/alice/document.txt
   ```

4. **Setting ACL for a User**:
   ```bash
   setfacl -m u:alice:rw /home/shared/resource.txt
   ```

5. **Deleting a User and Their Home Directory**:
   ```bash
   sudo userdel -r alice
   ```

These practices and commands help ensure secure and efficient management of users, groups, and permissions in Linux.

However, you can achieve this using a combination of cron jobs and shell scripts to automate the process. Here are some practical assignments and examples to help you understand how to set and remove permissions and ownerships based on time.

### Assignment Questions

#### 1. **Set Temporary Permissions Using a Script and Cron Job**
1. **Create a script to set read, write, and execute permissions for a user on a file, and then remove these permissions after a specified time.**
   - **Script**:
     ```bash
     #!/bin/bash
     # Set permissions
     chmod u+rwx /home/user/example.txt
     # Schedule removal of permissions after 1 hour
     echo "chmod u-rwx /home/user/example.txt" | at now + 1 hour
     ```

2. **Create a cron job to run the script at a specific time.**
   - **Cron Job**:
     ```bash
     crontab -e
     ```
     Add the following line to the crontab file:
     ```bash
     0 12 * * * /home/user/set_permissions.sh
     ```
     This cron job runs the script at 12:00 PM every day.

#### 2. **Set Temporary Ownership Using a Script and Cron Job**
3. **Create a script to change the ownership of a file to a specific user and group, and then revert the ownership after a specified time.**
   - **Script**:
     ```bash
     #!/bin/bash
     # Change ownership
     sudo chown john:developers /home/user/example.txt
     # Schedule reversion of ownership after 2 hours
     echo "sudo chown user:user /home/user/example.txt" | at now + 2 hours
     ```

4. **Create a cron job to run the script at a specific time.**
   - **Cron Job**:
     ```bash
     crontab -e
     ```
     Add the following line to the crontab file:
     ```bash
     0 14 * * * /home/user/change_ownership.sh
     ```
     This cron job runs the script at 2:00 PM every day.

### Examples

#### Example 1: Temporary Permissions
1. **Create the script `set_permissions.sh`**:
   ```bash
   nano /home/user/set_permissions.sh
   ```
   Add the following content:
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   chmod u+rwx /home/user/example.txt
   echo "chmod u-rwx /home/user/example.txt" | at now + 1 hour
   ```
   Save and close the file.

2. **Make the script executable**:
   ```bash
   chmod +x /home/user/set_permissions.sh
   ```

3. **Create the cron job**:
   ```bash
   crontab -e
   ```
   Add the following line:
   ```bash
   0 12 * * * /home/user/set_permissions.sh
   ```

#### Example 2: Temporary Ownership
1. **Create the script `change_ownership.sh`**:
   ```bash
   nano /home/user/change_ownership.sh
   ```
   Add the following content:
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   sudo chown john:developers /home/user/example.txt
   echo "sudo chown user:user /home/user/example.txt" | at now + 2 hours
   ```
   Save and close the file.

2. **Make the script executable**:
   ```bash
   chmod +x /home/user/change_ownership.sh
   ```

3. **Create the cron job**:
   ```bash
   crontab -e
   ```
   Add the following line:
   ```bash
   0 14 * * * /home/user/change_ownership.sh
   ```

These assignments and examples demonstrate how to use scripts and cron jobs to manage temporary permissions and ownerships in Linux.
